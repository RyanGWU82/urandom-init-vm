# Short-Description: Seeds the /dev/urandom pseudo-random number generator
# Description:       Seed the pseudo-RNG in /dev/urandom with a unique seed
#                    from random.org. This script is a modification of
#                    Ubuntu's stock /etc/init.d/urandom and is necessary when
#                    launching multiple virtual machines from the same image.
#                    Without an external seed, those virtual machines would
#                    share a single seed.
